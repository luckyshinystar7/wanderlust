## üéØ Goal of this project
At its core, this project embodies two important aims:

1. **Start Your Open Source Journey**: It's aimed to kickstart your open-source journey. Here, you'll learn the basics of Git and get a solid grip on the MERN stack and I strongly believe that learning and building should go hand in hand.
2. **React Mastery**: Once you've got the basics down, a whole new adventure begins of mastering React. This project covers everything, from simple form validation to advanced performance enhancements. And I've planned much more cool stuff to add in the near future if the project hits more number of contributors.

_I'd love for you to make the most of this project - it's all about learning, helping, and growing in the open-source world._
